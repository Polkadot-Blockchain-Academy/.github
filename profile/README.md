The Polkadot Blockchain Academy is the first of its kind â€” a classroom-based educational program covering the conceptual underpinnings and the hands-on application of blockchain technology, using Polkadot and Substrate as the foundations.
The Academy is a pioneering course which equips engineers with all the necessary knowledge to build blockchains.
The curriculum covers disciplines such as economics, governance, game theory, cryptography, peer-based and distributed network systems, systems and API design, and much more.
In addition to theoretical modules, students will apply their knowledge and build blockchains and parachains using Substrate and FRAME.

The mission of the Academy is to seed the web3 ecosystem with top-tier engineering talent.
As parachain project founders, employees, and contributors.
